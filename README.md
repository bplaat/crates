# Bassie's Rust crates

A collection of minimal Rust crates that I created for myself mainly for building REST API's

## Crates

-   [threadpool](lib/threadpool) A very basic thread pool
-   [http](lib/http) A simple HTTP/1.1 server
-   [router](lib/router) A simple router for HTTP library
-   [sqlite](lib/sqlite) A SQLite Rust library
-   [sqlite_derive](lib/sqlite_derive) Proc macro's for SQLite library

## TODO

-   [ ] Router: Remove regex dep
-   [ ] Router: Improve handler injection
-   [ ] Validate: Create garde replacement
